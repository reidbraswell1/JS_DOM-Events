# Exercise #1: SELECTING/MANIPULATING ELEMENTS
* Select Node #1 using the getElementById() method, and change the text to: “I used the getElementById(“node1”) method to access this”

* Select Node #2 using the getElementsByClassName() method, and change the text to: "I used the getElementByClassName("node2") method to access this"

* Select ALL the h3 tags using the getElementsByTagName() method, and change the text to: "I used the getElementByTagName("h3") method to access all of these"


# Exercise #2: CREATING/APPENDING/INSERTING ELEMENTS/OBJECTS
* Create a paragraph element using this element.createElement() and put this text inside "This node was created using the createElement() method"

* Append the created node to the parent node using the element.appendChild() method (Keep in mind that you’ll need to select the parent node first)

* Create a `<a>` element using this element.createElement() and put this text inside "I am a `<p>` tag"

* Insert the created `<a>` in the parent node, but before the `<p>` you just created using the element.insertBefore() method

* Add a link href to the `<a>` by selecting the anchorElement.link property

# Exercise #3: REMOVING/REPLACING ELEMENTS/OBJECTS
* Replace the "Child Node" with a new <p> element that reads "New Child Node" using the replaceChild() method.

* Remove the "New Child Node" using the remove() method or removeChild() method.

# Exercise #4: ANIMATIONS
* Create an animation that makes the box inside the container move from left to right.
    * Start by Selecting the box inside the container, then incrementing it’s position gradually to create the effect of the box moving across the container.

* **BONUS** - Make the red box go all the way around the perimeter of the green box

# Exercise #5: DOM EVENTS
* Write a function called "show" which creates a new div with an alerting message to the user with this message -> "Clicking the button triggers the onclick event, which calls the JS function show()... which alerts the user”

* This div should be a 'modal' that covers the main content on the screen

* **BONUS:** The modal popup should be able to be closed. Refactor for this functionality
